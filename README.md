# Game-of-Life

Game of Life, with color added to see how the colors can propogate over time.

Two colors added via seed: one cell for each color placed at initialization.

Color rule: number of each color surrounding a cell are counted; cell becomes color of largest count surrounding it.  If a tie, color randomly chosen.
