# Game-of-Life

Game of Life, with color added to see how the colors can propagate over time.

Game starts with all cells white.

Two colors added via seed: one cell for each color placed at initialization.

Color rule: number of each color surrounding a cell are counted; cell becomes color of largest count surrounding it.  If a tie, color randomly chosen.

Interesting to see which color will dominate, and how much white will remain when the game goes static.
